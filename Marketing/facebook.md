## tabletop

Hey tabletop enthusiasts ! My name is Louis, I'm a freelance web designer and developer, specialising in small business E commerce solutions.
Though my real passion is tabletop gaming (I especially love anything with a deck-building component).
My aim is to combine my skill set with my passion and develop / manage websites for tabletop/board/card game retailers, developers and publishers.
So if anyone here works in the industry / knows anyone that does, I'd love to be considered.
If you're not sure what you need or just want some free advice , I'm offering no strings attached reviews / consultations for anyone in (or looking to join) this industry.
You can contact me through my page on here, or directly through my website.
I'm also available for one off development jobs (eg. building a store/site) , ongoing contract work (eg. ongoing maintenance of an existing site)
