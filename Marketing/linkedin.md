Hey, I'm a UK based freelance python/js web developer (and hobbyist game developer) looking to work into the board/card/tabletop gaming space.
This is not a pitch, I'm just looking to expand my network in the right direction and meet people with similar skills/interests.

Hey <<NAME>>,
I'm Louis from phalycedevelopment.co.uk
I'm a web developer / designer, who recently worked on  the back-end / character creator for an ttrpg, turning a character sheet into a database was by far the most fun I've ever had at work.

As such I'm looking move into the ttrpg/board/card game space.

I'm currently contacting publishers/ designers/ companies in that industry  to offer a free no strings review/consultation of your existing site.

Thanks for your time.
