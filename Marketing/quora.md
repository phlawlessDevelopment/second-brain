## learn django ?


This may be a “hot take”, but In my experience learning a “batteries included” framework like Django first, can be overwhelming (I’ts not really complicated, but can look like a lot).
I’ve had the best results starting with a framework that does less for you (Flask is a good example), or even better no framework at all (plain HTML/JS/CSS). The advantage here is that once you do switch to  Django it feels like a **superpower, **and as an added bonus, will only take a day or two to learn.
I personally worked as a freelance web developer using Flask doing little projects for about 6 months before I took on a project that was incredibly complex and then decided to switch, watched a single short tutorial series (about 6 hours) and I’ve been developing in Django ever since, the reason this works is because every decision that Django makes about how to structure the project, what to include as default, how to deal with project settings made perfect sense to me (most of it was stuff I had already started doing in my Flask projects).

That said, different things work for different people, and I’m huge fan of Django. That’s just my two cents.

## best front end tool?


Unfortunately there’s no such thing as “best” when it comes to development tools.
There’s two main ways I look at it -
1. Look at the options and decide what you like the best.
2. Learn all the options and use the one that’s most suited to the specific web app you’re building.
I picked number 1, and use vuejs+ tailwind CSS to build  frontends for all my Django apps, and I make a good living running a web development company,  but someone who picked option 2 may be able to take on opportunities that I’m just not suited for.
The thing to understand when comparing similar tools (eg. vue, react, angular) is they were all created by different people to solve (largely) the same problem, they just have different priorities.
Here’s a (not great) analogy - A plain old screwdriver vs power drill with a screwdriver end attached (I know nothing about DIY) ,  which is better? You might say “of course it’s the power drill, I can take 50 screws in less that 5 minutes”, but what if you just needed to tighten a single screw ? The power drill is likely kept in a cupboard somewhere out of the way, and it might need to be plugged in, the humble screwdriver could well be in your pocket already.
