# Databases

	These are the databses I've used to build something.

##### SQLite 
Simple lightweight local #sql databse,ran into concurrency errors when trying to delete > 1000 records using django admin , suitible for development / smaller apps 

##### MySql 
Heavy duty #sql database created by oracle ([[Java]]), suitable for enterprise software.

##### SQL Server 
Heavy duty #sql database created by Microsoft , suitable for enterprise software.

##### Postgres 
Industry favourite #sql database, very open souce suitable for enterprise software.


# ORM

	An "Object Relational Mapper" acts as a bridge between the various slightly different sql syntaxes and the object model in programming languages  

##### SQAlchemy
#python ORM used as a [[Flask]] plugin in various projects.

##### Django
#python [[Django]] has a buit in ORM used as default in all projects.
